# GPRprocessing-Python
A list of functions that can be used directly in the Python environment for the processing of GPR data. The goal is to achieve automation of the processing sequence. The list was assembled in a context where data was acquired on cranberry fields covered with snow, i.e. flat fields with low dielectric losses.
